				<h2>AKM(Assault-Rifle)</h2><BR>
				<p>The AKM(Indian: AUTOMATIC KALASHNIKOV MODERNIZED)&(Russian: Автомат Калашникова модернизированный, tr. Avtomat Kalashnikova modernizirovanny, lit. 'Kalashnikov's Automatic Rifle Modernised') is an assault rifle designed by Soviet small arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1959. It was developed as a replacement to the AK-47 introduced a decade prior.<br>

                Introduced into service with the Soviet Army in 1959, the AKM is the most prevalent variant of the entire AK series of firearms and it has found widespread use with most member states of the former Warsaw Pact and its African and Asian allies as well as being widely exported and produced in many other countries. The production of these rifles was carried out at both the Tula Arms Plant and Izhmash. It was officially replaced in Soviet frontline service by the AK-74 in the late 1970s, but remains in use worldwide.</p>

				<h2>HK416(Assault-Rifle)</h2><br>
				<p>The Heckler & Koch HK416 is an assault rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. It is designed and manufactured by the German company Heckler & Koch.<br>

                 Although the design is based on the AR-15 class of firearm (specifically the Colt M4 carbine family issued to the U.S. military), it uses a proprietary short-stroke gas piston system from Heckler & Koch's earlier G36 family of rifles.

                  The HK416 is the standard assault rifle of the Norwegian Armed Forces and the United States Marine Corps (named M27), and it has been selected by the French Armed Forces to replace the FAMAS. Other users of the HK416 include the German Army and the Irish Army Ranger Wing, as well as the US Navy's SEAL Team Six, who used it to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011.</p>

				<h2>SCAR-L(Assault-Rifle)</h2><br>
				<p>In early 2004, United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued a solicitation for a family of Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifles, the so-called SCAR, designed around two different calibers but featuring high commonality of parts and identical ergonomics. The SCAR system completed low rate initial production testing in June 2007.<br>After some delays, the first rifles began to be issued to operational units in April 2009, and a battalion of the U.S. 75th Ranger Regiment was the first large unit deployed into combat with 600 of the rifles in 2009. The U.S. Special Operations Command later cancelled their purchase of the SCAR-L and planned to remove the rifle from their inventory by 2013. However, they will continue to purchase the SCAR-H version, and also plan to purchase 5.56 mm conversion kits for the SCAR-H, allowing it to substitute for the SCAR-L.</p>

				<h2>DP-12/DBS(Double-Barreled-Shotgun)</h2><br>
				<p>The DP-12 is a bullpup 12-gauge pump action double-barreled shotgun designed by Standard Manufacturing. It has two tube magazines, each of which feeds its own barrel. Each magazine tube can hold up to seven 2.75-inch (70 mm) 12-gauge shotshells or six 3-inch (76 mm) shotgun shells. 16 (2¾") or 14 (3") in total with indicator windows.<br>
					The DP-12 shotgun is a manually operated, pump action weapon. The first trigger pull fires the right barrel and the second fires the left.[2] The sliding forend is connected to the bolt by dual operating bars. Ammunition is fed from two independent magazine tubes, located below the barrels.

                    Rounds are loaded into the magazines through a large loading/ejection port, located at the bottom rear of the gun in the stock, behind the pistol grip. Empty shells are ejected down through the same port. The safety is an ambidextrous AR style lever located above the grip.

                    Sighting equipment is not included, but iron sights and/or a red dot sight can be installed using the standard Picatinny rail located above the barrels. A second Picatinny rail at the end of the slide (under the muzzles) can be used for a forward grip or other accessories.</p>

				<h2>s1897(Shotgun)</h2><br>
				<p>The Winchester Model 1897, also known as the Model 97, M97, Riot Gun, or Trench Gun, is a pump-action shotgun with an external hammer and tube magazine manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The Model 1897 was an evolution of the Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning. From 1897 until 1957, over one million of these shotguns were produced. The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and 16 gauge, and as a solid frame or takedown. <br>The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28 in (71 cm), while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30 in (76 cm) barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20 in (51 cm) or as long as 36 in (91 cm). Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured, it has been used to great effect by American military personnel,law enforcement officers,and hunters.</p>
